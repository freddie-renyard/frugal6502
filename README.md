# Introduction

This repository contains the design for a very low part count 6502 design. It was designed as a hobby project to learn more about writing in assembly and as a cheap retro computing project. I will upload more design documents, utilities, and general information to this repo as it becomes available.

The amazing Ben Eater series on the 6502 inspired this project; it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH
